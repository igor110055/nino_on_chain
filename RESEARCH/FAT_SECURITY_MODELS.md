- At their core, blockchains are high assurance, distributed accounting systems
- This system enables digital scarcity by preventing double spends and verifying outstanding supply in a costly / transparent fashion
- The nuances and ingenuity of the rise of computationally expensive triple entry accounting was discussed in "Bitcoin an Accounting Revolution"
- Accounting principles and their application to these systems was explored in "Introduction to Crypto Accounting"

- What has not been discussed to date is the competitive forces at play among these differing accounting schemes, and how this *could* impact the future prospects of a blockchain
- What's also not been discussed is the distribution of value that might fall into blockchains that aren't first in their category
- Other topics up for discussion include: Lindy Effect, the Pyramid of Priority in a blockchain
- Can show how Decred's evolution over time shows the progress and priority of the stack order in the Pyramid of Priority
- Explain reflexivity of the Pyramid of Priority

FAT SECURITY MODELS THESIS
# The ledger entries are the money, and the value of those entries is dependent on the reliability of the accounting scheme used to record + verify the validity of the entries
Inability to revert txs
Inability to steal balances
Inability to attack the chain
Inability to fork the chain
Inability to counterfeit
Onchain privacy, computation (i.e. smart contracts), throughput, governance are all things that represent tradeoffs, and while they do provide moats in some capacity - they do not create large + sustainable moats
# Privacy Pros + Cons
Pros: Transacting and value storage with a much higher degree of fungibility than what is currently offered with Bitcoin
Cons: Blockchain auditability and regulatory overhang (big deal in the speculation phase, as these coins are effectively battling for liquidity)
# Computation Pros + Cons
Pros: Enhanced onchain programmability helps usher in new developers, and potential usage for applications that are built on top of the platform
Cons: More vulnerabilities and scalability issues (i.e. blockchain bloat)
# Throughput Pros + Cons
Pros: Faster onchain final settlement 
Cons: Scalability issues
# Governance Pros + Cons
Pros: Adaptability. Quantifiable means for gauging social consensus, which offers a certain level of predictability that is higher than the Bitcoin anarchical scheme
Cons: Potential gamability of the governance scheme
These P2P networks establish a dominant record of events on blockchains (accounting), and do so through 3 different mechanisms: PoW, PoW+PoS, and PoS. In addition to establishing a dominant record of events, each of the aforementioned create costs necessary for fraud prevention. The combination of accounting + fraud prevention largely captures the essence of what these crypto-based systems are designed to do: track value and do so with a high degree of reliability. As these are value tracking systems, and the integrity of the accounting for such value is dictated by PoW, PoW+PoS, and PoS, a strong argument can be made that every cryptocurrency at its core is largely similar to all coins that share its accounting + fraud prevention scheme. For this reason, we believe that the dominant coins within these schemes will capture substantially more value than all other coins that are non-dominant in this regard.
# Data Completeness Costs:
PoS: Costless Forking
PoW: Cheap Forking
PoW+PoS: Expensive Forking
# Attack Costs:
PoS: Market Cap based
PoW: Hashrate based
PoW+PoS: Market Cap + Hashrate based
# Fat Protocol Thesis:
It’s important to note that Fat Protocols focused on the accrual differences between blockchains and the applications built on top of them, whereas our thesis focuses on competing networks and their battles for liquidity.
People took Fat Protocols and abused it; those who could’ve launched applications instead went the network route because they believed it would better attract liquidity
# Competing PoW, Pow+PoS, & POS Coins:
There will inevitably be bugs of some sort, this is not a good reason to diversify within the same vertical - owning 2 PoW/PoW+PoS/PoS coins makes zero sense, as you’re fundamentally making the same bet twice, but in a zero-sum fashion as the non-dominant coin will bleed purchasing power to the winner
# Social Scalability:
Security + Predictability = Social Scalability
Ability to provide the above (i.e. absolute assurance) will yield more social scalability
This is why dominant coins within a vertical are going to be the ideal places to park money - and why if they hold these spots for longer, the odds are that their dominance will become very difficult to upend
We should expect that dominant coins will become even more dominant with time i.e. “runaway dominance”, and thus the pareto distribution for value accrual

Summary: Best monies will dominate at Ledger Layer, can differentiate at Social Layer, and these coins will become the de facto places to store value. Utility will be built on top of these stores of value 	
Security + Predictability = Ledger Layer Score
Mental Cost + Gamability Risk = Social Layer Score
Ledger Layer Score + Social Layer Score = Money Layer Score
Ledger Layer = Ledger Consensus
Social Layer = Social Consensus
