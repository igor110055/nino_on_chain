1: My Story
    - Put less than $10k into crypto in 2016 and 2017
    - Been self employed since May 2017, using crypto to pay bills
    - Started truly focusing on crypto in summer 2018, after returning from a long travel stint in Asia / South America
    - Fell down the on-chain rabbit hole:
        - What excited me about it is that it was largely unexplored, which created room to find new things and build out a niche within the space
        - Since then I have worked as a DCR contractor, did contracting for a family office in UAE, and worked at Glassnode
        - My work at Glassnode ended in February 2022, which has turned into a pivot point for what I want to do moving forward
    - My GN exit resulted in a pivot for what I want to do for the following reasons:
        - Some of the early edge in on-chain was in having access to the data, now everyone has it
        - I feel like a lot of on-chain tooling is near the end of the tunnel for the most part, not exciting to me anymore
        - Once I worked there and realized i didnt learn much, made me think that the playing field is pretty level in this space now

2: Portfolio
    - Holdings: BTC + ETH + DCR + 1 year of cash
    - Performance: Since entering crypto, my portfolio has tracked BTC - approximately up 100x (DCR bag that i accumulated throughout 2019 has weighed on returns)
    - Trading: Have admittedly not done a ton until recently, was a pure bred analyst to be frank so dont have much to show here
    - Income: Passive income + contracting work

3: Outlook
Short Term Bullish:
- DeFi projects with high APRs
- I low key think TVL is a horrible metric for tracking bullishness on a DeFi project
- Why? Because DeFi has proven time and time again that the marginal buyers are mercenary capital
- Thus, it's all about high yields, and high TVL crushes APRs
- High APRs also gets the coin in question into users hands, with lower yields its just not as exciting
- TVL is bullish for L1s because they're used for gas, and higher TVL is a good proxy for utility, and utility = demand for L1 token as gas
- In some capacity gas becomes a mini HODL stash for ppl as they need a minimal amount to spend on-chain, which creates social stickiness
- This is why I think JEWEL is weirdly slept on, despite how much noise we see about it on twitter, because it's used as gas in crystalvale

Long Term Bullish: 
- I'm bullish on products that are actually innovative, not DEX #10892343
- Example: Trade Vaults, a product being released soon that disintermediates the historical fund structure and pools capital together for perps trading
- L1s with notably strong TVL uptrends
- Stablecoin related plays: doesnt feel saturated yet tbh, from what ive seen not a ton of bs copycats floating around and stables are replacing BTC as reserve asset
for the crypto space
- L1s with strong NFT ecosystems. Reason: by nature NFTs are illiquid JPEGs and far out on the risk curve, so if there are signs of a budding ecosystem,
it's a sign of maturity of an L1 asset and possibly becomes a worthy long term hold

4: Skills
- Accountant by education, passed all 4 parts of the CPA
- Python / Pandas / Working with large data sets / Pulling from APIs
- Bilingual in English and Spanish

5: Galaxy.eco Notes
Overview
- Shows liftime achievements as badges within web3 and within your real life (i.e. can show you attended a basketball game)
- Your Galaxy ID can also connect to things like twitter, so effectively links and documents your entire existence
- This is either utopian (tying together a cohesive picture of your life is good) or dystopian (too much information in one place)
- First concern i thought of is that if somebody gets access to your Galaxy ID it could become a really bad case of identity theft
- What I really likea about this product is that it really could expand the realm of trust online while also being able to provide 
customized experiences, which is currently difficult in Web3
- Furthermore, the use cases are borderline endless, so you can opt in to parts of the product that you're comfortable using is my guess
- Another thing thats also really cool is that it makes your on-chain footprint digestible, and on-chain data is unforgeable so it cant be faked

Token
- ~15% unlocked at TGE
- 6% unlocked quarterly
- Most of supply is held privately 
- GAL is used to pay for using the system, feels kinda similar to gas
- GAL is used to pay one time platform fee as well
- These are good for token, but potentially scares ppl off from using product 
- Decent user #s: 1.2 million registered for Galaxy ID, 300 protocols using Galaxy network, 500k credential based NFTs minted monthly
- This is roughly 4k users per protocol and 5 NFTs minted per year per user
- Coinlist public sale implies a $300M valuation (as far as crypto is concerned, doesnt seem insane, but not stupidly cheap either)
- When curation system goes live in Q1 2023, seems like a decent chance for GAL to get locked up while ppl bid up credentials that they like (this seems like the big 
catalyst for price pumping). This is also the first time normal ppl have a NEED for the GAL token as opposed to just devs / projects needing it
- They have a website upgrade as a part of the roadmap in Q2 this year :/ seems sus
- Not a whole lot of near term catalysts imo, especially in a rocky crypto market rn
- Personally, I would farm it on Binance if I was looking for some exposure to it especially considering you can farm with BUSD
- If it launches at $300M valuation FDV or ~$60M current market cap, it will be one of the lowest cap coins on binance
- Comparable market cap to LTO, which has 25k twitter follows vs 260k for Galaxy
- Around $5B on Binance launchpad staking to get $4.5M of GAL (based on last raise)
- Curation with skin in the game is cool, compare to Steemit which you could "curate" by upvoting people's posts with little skin in the game
- Not very robust governance, but kinda to be expected with a newish protocol

Innovations
- Owning stake in an NFT
- Curation with skin in the game
- Digital resume thats provable

Concerns
- I wonder how much revenue protocol is gonna generate and how much ppl are willing to pay to use the data
- There's no big demand side crunch until curated staking launches in Q1 2023

Blockchains made tx data public and verifiable, but curating it is a non trivial amount of work which is why businesses like Glassnode and Nansen exist
