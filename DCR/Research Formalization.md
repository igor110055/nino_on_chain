5: Emotional
    - Dont ever forget what it feels like after the bottom falls out knowing you didnt take enough profits
    - Stick to the game plan, when you change the rules is historically when you get boned
    - Dont force trades, take what the market gives you
    - Am I currently feeling euphoric, apathetic, or depressed?
    - Dont search for a homerun trade when things arent going well
    - Dont get impatient when you see other things running and youre not in them
    - Dont let somebody else's view on the market change yours
    - Parabolic charts induce fomo, do not knife catch on them! Buy them when they're trending up
    - Know when you're getting worn out on trying to nail a single trade and just get out of it

6: General
    - Ask yourself: what is the chart telling you?
    - Bull Trends: buying break outs much easier
    - Bear Trends: buying support much easier
    - Once you get trending BTC price action, ride the wave until signs of froth kick in or trend exhaustion become apparent
    - Check top performing coins on TradingView
    - Where does risk / reward feel skewed?
    - Are absolute shitcoins pumping (i.e. meme coins, etc)?
    - Is retail in the market (can look at things like fees to gauge this)?

    - Are there any signals within traded volume (i.e. a lot of high volume candles in a row)
    - Was there a bearish catalyst and price didnt dump? Was there a bullish catalyst and price didnt pump?

7: Derivatives

    - Are we in a positive / negative funding regime? Binance funding negative usually signals we're in accumulation
    - How does OI look? Does it look like profit taking, capitulation, extreme bullishness / bearishness?

8: Narratives
    - How is BTC behaving in comparison to its macro counterparts?
    - What are non obvious narratives? i.e. ETH going PoS so ETC pumps
    - Is the asset in question in value zone? Or does it at least have momentum?
    - How will new narratives / developments impact the flow of money?
