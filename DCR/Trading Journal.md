- Purchased $30k worth of jewel at $4.40
- Crystalvale coming in a few weeks
- Double bottom on usd pair in play
- Daily green heikin ashi
- BTC shrugged off first rate hike from the fed
- DeFi plays looking strong
- Jewel is down 80% from USD ATH
- Risk: BTC still hasnt broken out yet, so could drag it down
- Risk: Bought at diagonal USD resistance on the 4 hr chart
- Risk: I went all in with trading funds due to near term catalyst + BTC bullish break out possibility
- Stop: Cut on daily heikin ashi flipping red
- Target: $6.50 looks like a high confluence area on the JEWELUSD chart, $5.25 is another closer level
