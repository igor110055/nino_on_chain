- Crystalvale coming in a few weeks
- Double bottom on usd pair in play
- Daily green heikin ashi
- BTC shrugged off first rate hike from the fed
- DeFi plays looking strong
- Jewel is down 80% from USD ATH
- Risk: BTC still hasnt broken out yet, so could drag it down
- Risk: Bought at diagonal USD resistance on the 4 hr chart
- Risk: I went all in with trading funds due to near term catalyst + BTC bullish break out possibility
- Stop: Cut on daily heikin ashi flipping red
- Target: $6.50 looks like a high confluence area on the JEWELUSD chart, $5.25 is another closer level
- Note: Sold ~$5k of jewel around $4.82 per jewel to make 1v1t seed investment
- Note: Sold $8k worth of jewel around $6.95 to fund STG trade below
- Note: Repurchased $8.6k worth of JEWEL on 4hr heikin ashi flipping green on ONE, USD, & BTC pairs

- Purchased $8k worth of STG on TraderJoe at $2.55
- Network just launched, a mega layer zero to connect everything
- Purchased at the .236 fib retracement level
- Risk: Up 4x since launch, so a downward move could be gnarly

- Reentry: Bought 3325 STG for $9570
- Bounced off uptrend and 30 min / 1 hr heikin ashi flipped green
- Playing smaller timeframes so i cut winners and losers quick, high risk with this volatility
- Exit: Closed for a $800 loss - I dicked around once the 30 min went red on heikin ashi STICK TO GAME PLAN
- Reentry: Bought 1627 STG for $4350
- Bought accumulation cylinder support, will add other half on strength
- Stop: will close on new lows past the wick on 30 min candle
- Exit: Closed immediately after opening ($100 loss), too tired to trade 30 min candles on a Friday

3-25-22 (Trade Decision Tree)
- YFI: 30% on $10k = $3k or zero if it doesnt work
- ANT: 60% on $10k = $6k or zero if it doesnt work
- YFI: 30% on $5k = $1.5k or zero if it doesnt work
- ANT: 60% on $5k = $3k or zero if it doesnt work

Didnt take any of these trades

4-12-2022
- Purchased $16k worth of jewel at $4.867
- Daily Heikin Ashi is red, so did it at a little less than half size of trading portfolio
- Broke USD downtrend from the top
- 4hr heikin is green
- At weekly JEWEL/ONE weekly support for potential higher low
- Potential mean reversion play to ~$7
- Stop: Cut at a red 4hr heikin ashi, cant get too risky in these conditions
- Planned exit: at $7 or daily heikin ashi flipping red on a rip
- Can potentially add more if daily heikin ashi flips green
- Exit: Closed for $600 loss, mostly due to BTC getting cooked with equities, still signs of potential strength in JEWEL chart, be patient
